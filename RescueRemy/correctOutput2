Welcome to the Rat in the Maze program, where we will find a
path from the start cell to the end cell of a maze so that Remy
may escape.  You will first enter the data specifying the maze.
After that, if escape is possible, we show an escape path using
 DFS and then a shortest possible path

Enter the size (number of rows and columns of the square maze): 


Enter the start position
row index: column index: 
Enter the exit position
row index: column index: 

For each row, enter the column indexes of the open positions,
separated by spaces and terminated by an entry of 0

row 1: 
row 2: 
row 3: 
row 4: 
row 5: 

Your maze:

*******
*s|****
*|*****
*|*****
*|*****
*****e*
*******

Oh no, Poor Remy! There is now way to escape from the maze.
